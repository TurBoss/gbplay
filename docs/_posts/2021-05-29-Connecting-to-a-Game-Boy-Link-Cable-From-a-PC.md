## Putting theory into practice

Previous posts have described our process of learning about the Game Boy
hardware and how it's used. At this point, we have a good level of familiarity
with [how the link cable works]({{ intro_research_post }}), some
[useful tools]({{ link_emulation_post }}) for experimenting with the connection,
and some known good data to send. There's been a lot of research, and until now
we've only talked about how we can use our software tools with an emulator. It's
time to dive into the meat of this project: interfacing with original Game Boy
hardware!

This involves building an adapter to send data between a PC and Game Boy via the
link cable. Once constructed, the
[mock Pokemon trade data]({{ link_emulation_post }}#mock-pokemon-trader) from
last time can be sent to verify the connection. From there, we can take it a
step further and try connecting a real Game Boy to an emulated one. Let's get
started!

## Building a Game Boy link cable adapter

The eventual goal of this project is a plug and play solution in the form of a
nondescript dongle that connects to a Game Boy via the link cable and to a TCP
server over Wi-Fi. However, testing is much easier with a direct connection to
the console. So with this in mind, a good first step is a barebones USB to link
cable adapter. An Arduino Uno clone (i.e., ATmega328P-based development board)
was used, although any decent microcontroller would do the job just fine and the
final hardware will almost certainly use a different MCU. The Arduino is easy to
use to make a prototype quickly and has plenty of GPIO pins available.

To access the individual wires inside of the link cable without having to cut
into it, a small breakout board was used. Helpfully, one already existed with
[open-source CAD files](https://github.com/Palmr/gb-link-cable) available,
meaning it was very cost-effective to have a good number of them fabricated for
this project (100 boards for ~$10 -- more than enough for two people).

With a way to access the individual wires, it's straightforward to connect
them to the Arduino's GPIO pins and manipulate the GB SPI signals
programmatically. Bits must be sent one at a time. Per the
[protocol's specification]({{ intro_research_post }}#understanding-the-link-cable-protocol),
the microcontroller sets the output line high or low, according to the value of
the bit to send, and then pulses the clock line to indicate to the Game Boy that
a transfer is occurring. At the same time, it reads the input line to retrieve
the bit being sent by the Game Boy. After 8 bits have been shifted in and out in
this way, an entire byte will have been sent and received.

Since the Game Boy's link cable protocol is effectively SPI mode 3, existing SPI
libraries actually work fine for interfacing with it. But the protocol really
isn't that complex to implement, and part of the goal of this project is to
learn, so no libraries were used here. This way, we also have more control over
the precise timing if we need to tweak it later for compatibility. Below is our
code for exchanging a byte.

{% highlight c %}
byte transfer_byte(byte tx)
{
    byte rx = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
    {
        digitalWrite(PIN_SO, (tx & 0x80) ? HIGH : LOW);
        tx <<= 1;

        // http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/gblpof.gif
        // 120 us/bit
        digitalWrite(PIN_CLK, LOW);
        delayMicroseconds(60);

        byte rx_bit = (digitalRead(PIN_SI) == HIGH) ? 1 : 0;
        rx = (rx << 1) | rx_bit;

        digitalWrite(PIN_CLK, HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(60);
    }

    return rx;
}
{% endhighlight %}

As a sanity check, if we hard-code the Arduino to constantly send the value `1`
and then visit the Cable Club in Pokemon Red, the game displays the same message
as when it's connected to another copy! This confirms that the adapter is able
to successfully send bytes to the Game Boy. To validate the other direction of
data flow, we can send the received bytes to a PC over the Arduino's USB serial
interface. Doing so shows that the Arduino is reading the value `2` from the
Game Boy, which is correct! For details on the game's link cable protocol, see
the [previous post]({{ link_emulation_post }}#pokemon-link-cable-protocol).

%}

For flexibility, it's preferable to read and write link cable bytes entirely
from a PC rather than reprogramming the Arduino every time. This is simple
enough: we can continue to send the received bytes over USB serial to the PC as
we are now and read the next byte to send from USB serial as well. The code
running on the Arduino will block until it receives a byte from the PC, send
that byte to the connected Game Boy, read the byte sent by the Game Boy and
forward it to the PC, then repeat the process indefinitely. Although the final
dongle will use Wi-Fi, it will likely retain this USB serial capability as well
for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

The adapter is purposefully as low-level as possible, only providing a way to
send and receive single bytes at a time and nothing more. Keeping it close to
the hardware like this with no additional logic allows higher-level abstractions
to be built entirely in software on the PC side, which will be much easier than
doing it on the Arduino. Rapid iteration of tools which use the adapter is
important since this project is not very well-defined yet. As we go, if
assumptions are wrong, we don't want to have to throw away a ton of work. The
full source code for the adapter is available
[here]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/bc178aff79c9f9f7f8a14a57cd9b1daa8080bc1d/arduino/gb_to_serial/gb_to_serial.ino).

## Sending data to a Game Boy

With the hardware connection set up, it's time to send real data! We can make
use of the
[mock Pokemon trader script]({{ link_emulation_post }}#mock-pokemon-trader) from
last time, which is confirmed to work with an emulated Game Boy. First, a helper
class was created for interfacing with the USB link cable adapter. In a loop, it
calls a configurable callback function with the previously-received byte from
the Game Boy as input (or a null value, for the first call). It then takes the
byte returned by the function, sends it to the specified serial device (in this
case, our adapter), and saves the response for the next iteration of the loop.
The code for this serial link cable server is available
[here]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/8a8303c38790254442ceff6d3c58d969b00bb614/tools/python/common/serial_link_cable.py#L17).
It's modeled after the
[BGB link cable server]({{ link_emulation_post }}#bgb-link-cable-tcp-server)
described in the previous post, and in fact the callback function doesn't need
to know which server it's running within. This allows the same function to work
with both an emulator and real hardware.

We do, however, need to make two small modifications to the mock trader code
itself. Firstly, it must be able to handle null data as input (for the initial
call). Second, the script was originally written to mimic a copy of Pokemon
operating in slave mode (since our BGB link cable server only allows the
connected emulator to operate in master mode). However, for our use case a real
Game Boy can only operate in slave mode due to latency, and so the script needs
the ability to behave like a copy of Pokemon running in master mode. This isn't
too big of a change. In the
[role negotiation]({{ link_emulation_post }}#role-negotiation) step, the script
needs to send a `1` instead of a `2`.

Putting all of the pieces together, a new argument was added to the mock trader
script: the type of connection -- BGB or serial. If serial is chosen, the
state machine management class is instantiated in master mode and the serial
link cable server is used instead of the BGB link cable server. The updated code
is
[here]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/c679bf398207365e9dc5b9f5895d8dd54848d88c/tools/python/pokered-mock-trade/trader.py).
Running the script with a Game Boy-connected Arduino plugged into the PC works
as expected and a fake trade can be executed! Check out the video below for an
example.

At first, this was quite slow but it turned out that was because the adapter
code was waiting for more time than was necessary between each transferred byte.
It's not possible to know when the slave mode Game Boy is ready to send data.
Since everything is running on the bare CPU, games typically just count
cycles until "enough" time has passed to be sure that the other game is ready.
If the next byte is sent too early, the slave device could send bad or
incomplete data in response or get caught in a loop (preparing response,
received a byte, preparing response, etc.). If our adapter was operating in
slave mode this wouldn't be a problem since the second Game Boy would tell _it_
when to send the next byte via the clock signal. The delay between bytes was
initially set at a very conservative 100 ms. On its own, that's not much time at
all. But multiply it by the hundreds of bytes that Pokemon sends and it really
adds up. It turns out that the game will work with a delay as low as 5 ms,
lowering the time it takes to send trainer data from a little over a minute to
around 5 seconds -- similar to how long it normally takes with two Game Boys!

Different games will certainly have different delay requirements. We don't want
to choose an overly-large delay value that's safe in general, since it will slow
down games which don't need it. The server side will have to know how long to
wait at a minimum on a game-by-game basis. Although, it's likely that many games
will have similar timing needs. Further, the latency of the internet will
presumably be more than enough. More testing is required in this area with
different games.

## Connecting an emulator to a Game Boy

We've now verified that our adapter works and that real data can be sent and
received from a PC! There's one last tool at our disposal which still needs to
be tested with real hardware: an emulator connection. Connecting BGB to a real
Game Boy will be useful for testing how different games deal with latency and
unstable connections since the emulator has numerous debugging features that
allow changing and inspecting the game in real-time as it's running.

Using the server + callback function approach doesn't lend itself well to
connecting BGB to our adapter since the helper classes we've written so far for
each _both_ act as servers. So, another one was written -- a serial link cable
client, rather than a server. This class has one responsibility: to enable
sending a byte to the Game Boy and receiving its response. There's no loop or
server functionality, and in fact most of its code is related to connection
management since the [pyserial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
library takes care of the actual USB serial communication. It's simply a light
abstraction on top of our serial adapter protocol. Its code is available
[here]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/8a8303c38790254442ceff6d3c58d969b00bb614/tools/python/common/serial_link_cable.py#L39).

Putting it all together, a script was written which starts the
[BGB link cable server]({{ link_emulation_post }}#bgb-link-cable-tcp-server)
with the callback set to a function that uses the serial link cable
client class to send the BGB byte to the Game Boy and the Game Boy byte back to
BGB. Its code is
[here]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/8a8303c38790254442ceff6d3c58d969b00bb614/tools/python/bgb-serial-link/bgb_serial_link.py).
Connecting to Pokemon works flawlessly. I can even battle! Below is a video of
two very mismatched teams facing off in this way.

Beyond Pokemon, in theory it should "just work" for any two games, allowing us
to connect them without having to write any additional code. This is because
the emulator is operating in master mode and the Game Boy is operating in slave
mode -- just like two real Game Boys. There's no need for double-slave latency
workarounds here since the emulator/master can slow down or pause as necessary,
and therefore simply forwarding bytes back and forth is sufficient. The two
games are operating as they were designed to.

After Pokemon, I tried Tetris -- a game I've written no specific code to
support -- and it works too. See the video below.

## Future work

This was some great progress! We're able to send arbitrary data between a PC and
Game Boy -- both programmatically and from an emulator. We can use these new
tools to pry deeper into how the link cable protocols of specific games work and
to test assumptions and theories about the connection using real hardware.

With a hardware connection like this, it's also possible to start building a
backend multiplayer server, although until we have a better understanding of
what different games will require (e.g., timing, game-specific protocols, etc.)
it's best to stick with a lightweight prototype for now. A good next step will
be to use the USB link cable adapter to connect two Game Boys together through a
PC. From there we can try a LAN connection using two different PCs, and then a
link over the internet!

A whole bunch of doors have just opened up!
